# Slides preparation from Tableau reports

Description: this script helps save time on presentation preparation. Instead of manually filtering multiple tableau views, taking screenshots and pasting them in the deck with further editing, simply run this script to perform all those actions automatically.

1.Click the "Run" button and wait for the script to finish.

This script deletes all images and adds new ones from tableau. You can adjust the position/size of the images in the "VIEWS_TO_INSERT" section in the code.
